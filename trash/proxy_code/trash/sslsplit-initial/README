SSLsplit - transparent and scalable SSL/TLS interception

## Overview

SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted
network connections.  Connections are transparently intercepted through a
network address translation engine and redirected to SSLsplit.  SSLsplit
terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original
destination address, while logging all data transmitted.

SSLsplit supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP and HTTPS connections over both
IPv4 and IPv6.  For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLsplit generates and signs
forged X509v3 certificates on-the-fly, based on the original server certificate
subject DN and subjectAltName extension.  SSLsplit fully supports Server Name
Indication (SNI) and is able to work with RSA, DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and
ECDHE cipher suites.  SSLsplit can also use existing certificates of which the
private key is available, instead of generating forged ones.  SSLsplit supports
NULL-prefix CN certificates.

See the manual page sslsplit(1) for details on using SSLsplit and setting up
the various NAT engines.


## Requirements

SSLsplit depends on the OpenSSL and libevent 2.x libraries.
The build depends on GNU make and a POSIX.2 environment in PATH.
The (optional) unit tests depend on check.

SSLsplit currently supports the following operating systems and NAT engines:
-   FreeBSD: pf rdr, ipfw fwd, ipfilter rdr
-   OpenBSD: pf rdr
-   Linux: netfilter REDIRECT and TPROXY
-   Mac OS X: ipfw fwd


## Installation

make
make test       # optional unit tests
make install    # optional install

Dependencies are autoconfigured using pkgconfig.  If dependencies are not
picked up, you can specify their respective locations manually by setting
OPENSSL_BASE, LIBEVENT_BASE and/or CHECK_BASE to the respective prefixes.

You can override the default install prefix (/usr/local) by setting PREFIX.


## Development

SSLsplit is being developed on Github.  For bug reports, please use the Github
issue tracker.  For patch submissions, please send me pull requests.
